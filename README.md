# Skills for Hire Atlantic - Capstone Project Submission Template

This repository serves as a template for your capstone project submission. Your final submission should be a GitHub repository link containing all required materials.

---

## What to Submit

Your repository must include:

1. **A walkthrough video** (5-7 minutes)
2. **Written responses** to three required questions
3. **Your project code**

---

## Repository Structure

Organize your submission as follows:

```
your-repo/
├── README.md           # Project overview (this file, customized for your project)
├── video/              # Your walkthrough video or link to video
├── answers/            # Written responses to the three questions
└── project/            # All your code, data, and outputs
```

---

## Requirements

Your project must incorporate three core concepts:

### 1. Data Processing

Include at least one of the following:

- Data cleansing
- Data manipulation
- Data visualization

### 2. Machine Learning

Include at least one of the following:

- Regression
- Classification
- Clustering
- Neural Networks

### 3. Generative AI

Use Generative AI at any stage of your project:

- Ideation and research (brainstorming, refining problem statements)
- Coding and development (writing, debugging, documenting code)
- System integration (building an NLP application or similar)

---

## Walkthrough Video Requirements

Your 5-7 minute video should:

- Demonstrate what you built and what it produced
- Walk through the build, showing or describing key results
- Explain what the results mean in relation to your original problem
- Note any limitations, assumptions, or constraints
- Show how you achieved each of the three requirements (Data Processing, ML, GenAI)

---

## Written Response Questions

### Question 1: Problem Definition

Describe the problem you chose to work on and why it is worth solving. Include:

- A clear definition of the problem or question you are addressing
- The context of the problem
- What a useful outcome would look like

### Question 2: Approach and Tool Selection

Explain how you decided to approach the problem and which tools or techniques you selected. Include:

- Your overall approach at a high level
- The specific tools, methods, or techniques you used and why they were appropriate
- Other approaches you considered and why you didn't choose them

### Question 3: Reflection

Write a reflection on what you learned by completing this project. Cover:

## Grading Rubric Summary

| Component  | 1 Point (Limited)                      | 2 Points (Adequate)                          | 3 Points (Strong)                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Video      | Unclear execution, vague results       | Clear demonstration, basic explanation       | Confident walkthrough, meaningful outputs, thoughtful discussion |
| Question 1 | Vague problem, unclear outcome         | Clearly defined, reasonable context          | Specific problem, strong context, well-articulated value         |
| Question 2 | Unclear approaches, weak justification | Logical approaches, basic justification      | Well-structured, thoughtfully justified, alternatives considered |
| Question 3 | Shallow reflection, few takeaways      | Identifies what worked/didn't, some learning | Thoughtful, specific lessons, demonstrates growth                |
